### Abstract

Data visualization is a research discipline involving computer science techniques in which numeric data is transferred into visual information. This is especially important when dealing with the exploratory analysis of data since humans are better at interpreting visual information rather than just numbers on their own. Thus, in this chapter, basic visualization techniques will be introduced, and their application in different stages of the data analysis process will be discussed. Alongside theoretical explanations, a practical example using Python code as well as the latest data visualization libraries and tourism data will be provided.
